                <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
                <p>Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into
                    energy.</p>
                <p>Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose) and released into your
                    bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin
                    acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.</p>
                <p>If you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use the insulin it makes
                    as well as it should. When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much
                    blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as
                    heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.</p>

                <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
                <p>There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while
                    pregnant).</p>
                <h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
                <p>Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by
                    mistake) that stops your body from making insulin. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often develop
                    quickly. It’s usually diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 diabetes,
                    you’ll need to take insulin every day to survive.</p>
                <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
                <p>With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well and can’t keep blood sugar at normal levels.
                    About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It develops over many years and is usually
                    diagnosed in adults (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). Type 2 diabetes can be
                    prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating healthy food, and
                    being active.</p>
                <h3>Gestational Diabetes</h3>
                <p>Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes. If you have gestational
                    diabetes, your baby could be at higher risk for health problems. Gestational diabetes usually goes
                    away after your baby is born but increases your risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. Your baby is
                    more likely to have obesity as a child or teen, and more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in
                    life too.</p>
